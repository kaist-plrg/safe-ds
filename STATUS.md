# Status

We apply [FSE'21 Artifact Evaluation](https://2021.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2021-artifacts)
for **Reusable** and **Artifacts Available** badges.  We believe that
researchers can utilize and improve dynamic shortucts starting from SAFE_DS
accelerating JavaScript static analyzer SAFE to other JavaScript analyzers or
even analyzers for other languages.  For reusability, we wrote several documents
including installation and commands for a new target program.  For availability,
we published our artifact as [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/safe-ds).
